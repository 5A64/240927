We want to figure out how best to support children in orphanages. Which orphanages actually require funding? Are orpahanages necessary, is there a better solution? How can we generate sustainable funding? So we're going to start small, experiment, figure out the optimal solutions, and then scale up so that all children have an opportunity to flourish.

We'll document everything here.
