A good name for a foundation or organization is important. Why? It summarizes the essence of the mission and centers the organization’s core beliefs. And of course, we wanted a catchy, and meaningful name for our venture.  
 
As described in our previous post (“Why did we start this project?”), some of our core beliefs stemmed from Christian perspectives. So, we delved into biblical references and recalled the story of Boaz and Ruth. Ruth, recently widowed, chooses to support her elderly mother-in-law, Naomi, who is also a widow, despite having no obligation to do so. In her kindness, she meets Boaz, a relative of Naomi’s late husband. Recognizing Ruth’s devotion, Boaz generously allows her to glean leftover grain from his fields and becomes her provider/protector, ensuring she and Naomi can sustain themselves. The pivotal location where Ruth and Boaz meet is the ***<u>threshing floor</u>***, where grains are separated from their chaff (outer covering), resulting in a valuable product. This process symbolizes transformation - purification and refinement from past experiences and circumstances, shedding one’s former state to emerge as a renewed and improved version of oneself. It was traditionally a place of hard work, provision and celebration after a successful harvest. We want our organization to represent these ideas, by providing orphans or neglected children the support they require to thrive and realize their potential despite their setbacks.
