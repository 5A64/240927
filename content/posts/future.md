We started this project to be a part of the solution in supporting orphans and neglected children. This was a small-scale pilot project, for us to learn and figure out, with our current skillsets and resources, our blind spots in running an orphanage. 

After 12-months of this pilot project, what have we realized that needs to happen before we embark on larger projects? We’ve mapped a proposed blueprint on what we believe is the ideal vision for operating an orphanage and have recognized the importance of family re-integration of non-orphans. Transparency is everything and we should constantly learn about what makes an effective and optimized charity. But ultimately after reflecting on all these learnings, it distills down to a single truth: we need more become more capable and allocate our full attention and time to this mission. 

Our full-time devotion to this cause will naturally come in due course but increasing our capabilities requires more training. We need to become so much more competent at creating the correct solutions that orphans and neglected children desire rather than following the conventional paths of charity/voluntourism that can only provide temporary relief. We must build sustainable funding sources so that we as guardians can guarantee the long-term runway for orphans to develop and flourish. We have to become well-rounded people with diverse experiences and mindsets so that we can offer children every possible opportunity out there. 

What will this increased competence mean for the each of us? 

5A64: My desire in becoming more competent will materialize by building capital via 10x-100x investments to act as the financial fuel in increasing the agency of individuals irrespective of their status or location. I hope that this in turn gives everyone an opportunity to bloom. It might be some time before I actively engage in supporting orphanages, but that doesn’t change why I started this journey. I’m going to continue doing what I believe I was born to do – discovering and backing talent – and this will continue in the areas of philanthropy and orphan care. I will use my resources to bring their visions to life. 

Jessie: In the next 5-10 years, I hope to increase my entrepreneurial capacity to generate independent funding, while continuing to educate myself about the most effective ways to operate orphanages. Through this project, I’ve understood how important it is to be an all-rounder as a founder of a charitable organization – being a strong leader, nurturer, strategist and visionary all at the same time doesn’t always come easy to everyone. But I hope that I can achieve it all and become a dependable source of unconditional love for children who deserve care and support. I’m also going to continue to explore the world and find joy in learning about its novelties and share this information with others to practice what I would like to do for the children in the future. Like those before me, I simply wish to be part of the chain reaction that spreads goodness in the world, inspiring others to become a light in turn.  

We want to end this blog post and 12-month journey with a heartfelt thank you. To Brenton Whittaker OAM and Komang Kusala from Bali Kids, Pastor Victor and his lovely family from Chloe Orphans, Fitri, Iluh and Kris of Hope Children’s Home, Annetta DeVet and her awesome team from Humanitarian Services of Children of Vietnam (HSCV), Nguyen from Bo De Pagoda, Madam Rita, Sir Xavier and Sir Nagesh from Alamba Charitable Trust, Joyce Connoly from Snehalaya Home of Love, and everyone else who shared their time and insights – your conversations have been invaluable. The knowledge we’ve gained from you will set us up for when we’re ready for the next stage of this project. 

To our future selves and those on the same mission, see you soon.
