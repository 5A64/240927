      <description>In 2024, we started a casual conversation about the current perceptions and state of orphanages. And as two friends in STEM academia, we realized we could delve deeper and gain a better understanding by doing our own self-driven research project. As we read more about this topic, we started to ask more around the fundamental question – ‘how best can we support children in orphanages?’. We’re going to start small, experiment, figure out the optimal solutions, and then scale up so that disadvantaged/neglected children have an opportunity to flourish.</description>
